# libbzip2-rs: a safer libbzip

This repository contains a Rust implementation of the bzip2 file format that is compatible with the libbzip2 API.

This repository contains the following public crate:

* [libbz2-rs-sys](https://crates.io/crates/libbz2-rs-sys/), a libbzip2-compatible C API.

## How to use libbzip2-rs in your project

libbzip2-rs can be used in both Rust and C projects.

### Rust projects

<!--
FIXME uncomment the following text once https://github.com/alexcrichton/bzip2-rs/pull/110 lands.
By far the easiest way to use libbzip2-rs is through the [bzip2-rs](https://crates.io/crates/bzip2-rs) crate, by simply enabling the `libbz2-rs-sys` feature gate. This will enable the `libbz2-rs-sys`
backend.
-->

For the time being using the C api exported by the `libbz2-rs-sys` crate is the only way to use it from Rust. There is an [open PR](https://github.com/alexcrichton/bzip2-rs/pull/110) for the [bzip2-rs](https://crates.io/crates/bzip2-rs) crate to make usage significantly easier.

## C projects

libbzip2-rs can be built as a shared object file for usage by C programs that dynamically link to libbzip2. Please see the example in [libbz2-rs-sys-cdylib](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/libbzip2-rs/tree/main/libbz2-rs-sys-cdylib).

## Acknowledgment
